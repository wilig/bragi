# Bragi 
### The norse god of poetry, eloquence, and wisdom.
 -- _To say that's aspirational is a massive understatement._  (*wilig*)

## Bragi will eventually be a toy text editor
It's mostly a vehicle for it's author to explore building software in Odin.  Along the way, experience will be gained in the trade offs involved in building text based interfaces, and document handling.

## Current status

* Mostly still in the planning phase.  
* Core algorithms are being explored.
